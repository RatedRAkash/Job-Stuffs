## Technical Interview Experience at REVE Systems

Last year, I gave technical interviews for a software engineer position at three different companies - Samsung R&D, ShellBeHaken, and REVE Systems. Getting an offer from REVE Systems, I joined them in May 2024. I want to share the experiences of my recruitment journey and interview experiences. Today, I will begin with REVE Systems.

## Online Screening Exam

REVE Systems conducted campus recruitment at my undergrad university, SUST. They have different departments such as R&D, E-Gov, REVE Chat, etc. In our university, they performed recruitment for the R&D department focusing on DEV roles. At first, the HR collected our CVs. Then the online screening exam is held on 22nd February, 2024. The exam was an MCQ type covering areas such as basic problem solving, data structure, algorithms, object-oriented programming, SQL, computer networking, design principles, etc. It was conducted via Zoom, and all the participants were required to keep their microphones and cameras on. 

## Technical Round I

After the online screening exam, they contacted me on the 4th March to participate in the first technical round via Skype on 5th March. In total, they have two technical rounds, both of which were conducted online via Skype. On the first technical round, two senior software engineers were present. At first, they told me to introduce myself briefly and to tell about any of my recent projects. As I have a mix of experiences in different areas, I emphasized my strengths and told about my academic studies, such as last semester's (7th) undergrad GPA (3.96), the research paper I wrote and submitted for publication (IEEE Xplore), my problem-solving capabilities (not competitive programming), and results on competitions I participated in (1st runner up in recent datathon, IIT DU). I represent myself in a manner that shows that I was equally passionate about academics, problem-solving, and extracurricular activities.

At first, they gave me the problem of reversing a linked list and shared a Google Doc for writing the pseudocode. As this is a classical problem and I have solved it many times during my preparation using LeetCode (Blind 75), I was familiar with the optimal answer. But at first, I gave the worst answer with extra memory, and was asked not to use extra memory. Then I gave the correct answer, pretending to think for some moment. Actually, this is the best strategy, not to give the correct answer at first, then they might think you have memorized the answer. Rather, give an unoptimal answer and work toward the optimal answer, interacting with the interviewers.

Later, they give problems on BFS, DFS, Recursion (Fibonacci Series), and String manipulation. I maintained the same strategies as mentioned earlier and gave the worst answer first, later working on the correct answer. Actually, these problems were from the LeetCode Blind 75 series, with some modifications from the interviewers' sides.

They asked a few basic questions on object-oriented programming, and one of the interviewers asked about REST APIs.

Here is my solutions on LeetCode's Blind 75 series:

## Technical Round II

As I was asked a few questions on object-oriented programming in my first technical interview, I gave special focus on it during preparation for the second interview, as Java is used extensively in R&D, so it is certain that they will ask deeply about it. My second technical interview was conducted on 12th March. I mainly read the Java documentation from Oracle, which was very helpful. During the second interview, two interviewers were present, and both of them were project managers. As expected, they asked many questions about object-oriented programming. Also, they questioned computer networking, mainly the TCP and UDP protocols, from software engineering, and design patterns. At last, they asked for string matching algorithms (Naive, KMP).

I followed this Java documentation from Oracle

## CTO Round

The CTO round was conducted on 31st March, where the CTO and the head of the Mobile App development team were present. This was an onsite round. They asked about my goals and why I wanted to join them as a software engineer rather than joining academia. At this stage, they asked questions from all the areas where I struggled during my previous technical rounds and made mistakes. I guessed it beforehand and prepared myself for that before the CTO round, which helped me a lot in responding to the queries in that round.

## Final Offer

I was given the final offer on 12th May and joined REVE Systems on 19th May. 

I hope this interview experience will be helpful to someone. If you have any queries, feel free to reach me. I will be glad to respond.
