ArrayList
	Original capacity is 10 if none specified
	Size increases by 50% of current size when reaches capacity
	Not synchronized

Vector
	Almost same ArrayList
	Doubles twice in size when capacity reaches
	Synchronized
	Stack is a subclass



*Set uses map as their underlying data structure.
*LinkedHashSet/LinkedHashMap preserves insertion order
*Treemap uses red black binary tree which is a self balanced binary tree. Treemap is sorted. Can't contain any null key but can have multiple null values.
*Hashmap can have 1 null key.
*Queue offer returns false if capacity reached whereas add throws exception.
*Vector and arraylist are almost same. Vector is synchronized hence slow. Also vector doubles in size when capacity reaches and arraylist grow 50%.
