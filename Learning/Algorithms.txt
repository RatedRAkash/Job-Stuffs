*Divide and conquer means first divide into smaller sub problems. solve the smaller sub problems then merge
*Binary search is decrease and conquer
*Greedy algorithm: Prim's, krushkal's finds minimum spanning tree

* Minimum spanning Tree
	Spanning tree of a connected graph is a tree that connects all the vertice
	MST is the spanning tree with the minimum cost
	Example: Prim's, Krishkal's. Works for undirected and connected graphs only

* Dijkstra's Algorithm
	Finds shortest paths from source to all nodes
	Only works in connected graph
	Very similar to prim's algo.
	Difference with Prim's
		While updating the weight we have to consider the weight of the current node
		Works for directed graph too
