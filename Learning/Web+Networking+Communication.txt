* IP address
	An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.
	Layer 3 address

* IPv4 - 32 bit : 8 * 4 bits
* IPv6 - 128 bit : 4 * 8 hexadecimal digits
* MAC
	Called physical address
	48 bit : 6 * 2 hexadecimal digits
	Example: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
	First half manufacture id, second half device identifier
	Hardcoded during production
	layer 2

* VPN
	hides ip
	encrypts data
* Proxy
	app level
	hides ip
	doesn't encrypt data
* Firewall
	check incoming and ongoing traffic
	user can set rules for blocking traffic

* Default gateway: Ip address for communicating with outside network. Routers private address is the network's default gateway

* HTTP
	A “stateless” protocol.
	There is no “built-in” standard to keep track of interrelated requests.
	Each request is treated as independent.
* DHCP
	Dynamic Host Cofiguration Protocol
	Grants ip address dynamically to the nodes in the network.
* DNS
	Domain Name System
* ARP
	Address resolution protocol
	Used to resovle ip address to mac address
	Device uses mac address and not ip address to communicate on local network
* Routing Table
	Used to determine which gateway to use to send the data
	Determines next hop based on the rules
* Ping
	Use for testing reachability of host
	Uses Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) which is coupled with the IP protocol

* Encryption
	Symatric
	Asymatric
	RSA, AES



* Remaining
	statefull vs stateless
