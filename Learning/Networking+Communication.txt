* Distributed System
	A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions by passing messages in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

* Network topology
	Bus
	Ring
	Star
	Tree
	Mesh
	Hybrid

* Client server architecture
	There is a specific centralized server where specific clients are connected to. Clients can only communicate or make requests through the server. Server responds to all the clients requests based on the clients requirements. Ex: whatsapp

* Peer to peer architecture
	There is no centralized server in peer to peer architecture. Each node can act as a server or client and can directly communicate. Ex: bitCoin, bitTorrent.

* OSI model
	The OSI(Open System Interconnection) model describes an idealized network communications with a family of protocols.
	Layers
		1. Physical layer
		2. Data link layer
		3. Network layer
		4. Transport layer
		5. Presentation layer
		6. Session layer
		7. Application layer

* TCP/IP model
	The TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, whereas IP stands for Internet Protocol. TCP/IP is an implementation of the OSI model.

		1. Physical layer
		2. Data link layer
		3. Internet layer
		4. Transport layer
		5. Application layer

* Classless addressing

* Subnet Mask
	A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses

* CIDR(Classless Inter Domain Routing) prefix
	Alternate way of writing subnet mask

* IP address
	An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.
	Layer 3 address
	Private IP
		Used to identify a device and communicate on the local network.
		Can't access the outside network or web.
		Private IP Address range:
			10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255,
			172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255,
			192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
	Public IP
		Public IP Address is used to communicate outside the network.

* IPv4 address
	The IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a network interface on a machine.
	32 bit : 4 * 8 bits
* IPv6 address
	128 bit : 8 * 4 hexadecimal digits
	The primary function of IPv6 is to allow for more unique TCP/IP address identifiers to be created, now that we've run out of the 4.3 billion created with IPv4.

* MAC
	Called physical address
	48 bit : 6 * 2 hexadecimal digits
	Example: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
	First half manufacture id, second half device identifier
	Hardcoded during production
	layer 2 address

* Network address
	1st address of the network. It is used to identify the network.
* Broadcast address
	An address that enables transmission to every node in a local network.
	This is usually the last address of the network.

* NAT
	Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.

* Default gateway
	For communicating with outside network. Routers private address is the network's default gateway

* DHCP
	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	Grants ip address dynamically to the nodes in the network.
	PORT: 67/68
* DNS
	Domain Name System
	Maps domain to the corresponding IP address
	PORT: 43
* ARP
	Address resolution protocol
	Used to resovle ip address to mac address
	Device uses mac address and not ip address to communicate on local network
	Layer 3(Internet) protocol
* Routing Table
	Used to determine which gateway to use to send the data
	Determines next hop based on the rules
* Ping
	Use for testing reachability of host
	Uses Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) which is coupled with the IP protocol

* TCP vs UDP
	Tranmission Control Protocol. User Datagram Protocol
	Layer 4 protocol
	Connection oriented. Connection less
	Has acknowledgement. No acknowledgement
	Reliable. Not reliable
	Slow. Fast

* HTTP
	A “stateless” protocol.
	There is no “built-in” standard to keep track of interrelated requests.
	Each request is treated as independent.
	PORT: 80
* HTTPS
	Secure http. Encrypts http request and respones.
	PORT: 443

* SMTP
	Simple mail transfer protocol
	PORT: 25

* FTP
	File transfer protocol
	Uses TCP
	PORT: 20/21
